## 🙋 About Me:

I'm Pedro, enrolled in Computer Science at Universidade Federal de Alagoas, fourth semester. Currently I'm working in a Scientific Initiation (PIBIC) developing a Data Lake that absorbs data generated from IoT devices, one of my functions is to develop the data pipeline (Airflow, Kafka and Python) and the cluster (Couchbase Server). I'm looking for an opportunity to work in a project I believe and learn experience doing the <s title="loses only to cycling 😄🚴">*second*</s> thing I love most: coding.  

On my personal studies, I'm very interested in back-end development, as I'm familiar with Data Bases (NoSQL and SQL, mainly SQL) because, in addition to the Scientific Reseach, I really like the college discipline (Relational Algebra, Data Modelling and SQL). The technologies I'm focusing right now are Rust, Node.js and Express, also, I know the basics of Flask. Futhermore, I'm passionate about Algorithms and Data Structures for Coding Competitions (ICPC, Codeforces, AtCoder, etc.) and personally, I believe this habit really made me develop strong coding skills and computational thinking.
